# Object Oriented Programming - Practice Project

Hello! This is my Java practice project for learning Object Oriented Programming.  
I am a beginner and I made small exercises to understand classes, objects, inheritance, and interfaces.
And to practice Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction firsthand.

## What is inside
- Chapter exercises like shapes, notifications, bank account, and books  
- A simple Library Catalog mini project

## How I run it
I open the project in IntelliJ IDEA and run the `Main` classes inside the folders.

## Notes
This is purely for practicing oop concepts!
